  A croissant, also known as a croissant (from the French croissant ), of Austrian origin , is a breakfast cake made from p√¢te feuillet√©e (sponge), produced from flour , yeast, butter , milk , and salt .
 <br />
The right croissant should be spongy, crispy, and tearable. The inside of the intestine should not be dense, on the contrary, it must be quite empty (which is proof that the yeast makes the dough well developed).
 In Vietnam most croissant shops follow the recipe of milk bread (or called fresh bread ). In terms of the croissant recipe, it can be said that this cake stands between the p√¢t√© chaud (sponge) and the bread (the inside is floated by yeast).
